## Issues

1. **User Deletion Validation**: [Link](https://github.com/Mike-Sudol/user_management/issues/2)
   
Currently we are not checking if the user is an admin before they delete a user, lets fix this this by checking in the function first.


2. **Database Issues**: [Link](https://github.com/Mike-Sudol/user_management/issues/8)
   
The way we are allocating database instances to our services is heavily suboptimal

3. **Race Condition**[Link](https://github.com/Mike-Sudol/user_management/issues/6):
   
We have a potential infinite loop in an await that really slows down our execution or can stop the program all together, lets add a limit to how many times we check in the while before exiting.
   

4. **Email validation**: [Link](https://github.com/Mike-Sudol/user_management/issues/4)
   
When we verify emails, we aren't checking if they exist before we pass them on, lets fix this by checking first.

5. **CVEs and Conflicting Dependencies**: [Link](https://github.com/Mike-Sudol/user_management/issues/1)
    
Currently we have CVEs in our software as well as dependencies that are conflicting with each other, we need to change our requirements.txt to fix this

## Features

Created a separate API endpoint for managers and admins to upgrade a user to professional status.
